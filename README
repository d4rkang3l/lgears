Education experiment on implementing scheme vm and compiler.

Source structure:

scheme - scheme sources
scheme/sc - compiler itself
vm - vm sources

At this moment, you need a external scheme implementation to run the compiler,
I prefer ypsilon, but you can use any r6rs implementation after rewriting some
ypsilon-dependent code (I will do it in the future).

So if you want to play with lgears:
run `make' to build VM
from scheme/ run `./main.scm test.scm' (need ypsilon)
You will see a lot of debug info and compilation stage dumps.
compiler will create files:
	compiled/test.scm.o - bytecode
	compiled/test.scm.dbg - debug symbols

To execute bytecode run: `../vm/vm compiled/test.scm.o'
